```
About this bot : Discord bot for NTNU CP2 course 2024

Functions :
Receiving commands from user via discord server text channel or direct messages to bot.

Notice that you should not consider bot's reply as standard answer since all the replies
from bot are connected to my code, which means I cannot guarantee that the answer is 100% right.
Therefore, you should not argue with TAs while the answers from bot are different from TAs'

How to send command to the bot:
By discord. Both dm and server's command are working.

P.S.
Sometimes the bot might be offline, please contact me and I will fix it as soon as possible.
The bot may be terminated after the course/sememster end, but I will make sure
it comes after I published the source code.
